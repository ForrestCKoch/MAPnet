	abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a non-invasive in vivo method for characterizing the integrity of anatomical connections and white matter circuitry and provides a quantitative assessment of the brain's white matter microstructure. DTI studies reveal age-related declines in white matter fractional ansiotropy (FA) in normal healthy adults in whom volume declines are not necessarily detectable. The decline is equivalent in men and women, is linear from about age 20 years onwards, and has a frontal distribution. Studies combining regional DTI metrics and tests of specific cognitive and motor functions have shown that age-related declines in white matter integrity are associated with similar declines in interhemispheric transfer, especially dependent on frontal systems. Emerging from recent DTI findings and conceptualizations of neural causes of cognitive decline in aging, we propose three white matter-mediated neural system hypotheses of aging brain structure and function: (1) the anteroposterior gradient, (2) bilateral recruitment of brain systems via the corpus callosum for frontally based task execution, and (3) frontocerebellar synergism. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive but establish a basis for posing testable questions about brain systems recruited when those used in youth are altered by aging.},

	abstract = {Among brain tumors, gliomas are the most common and aggressive, leading to a very short life expectancy in their highest grade. Thus, treatment planning is a key stage to improve the quality of life of oncological patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique to assess these tumors, but the large amount of data produced by MRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. So, automatic and reliable segmentation methods are required; however, the large spatial and structural variability among brain tumors make automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), exploring small 3 Ã—3 kernels. The use of small kernels allows designing a deeper architecture, besides having a positive effect against overfitting, given the fewer number of weights in the network. We also investigated the use of intensity normalization as a pre-processing step, which though not common in CNN-based segmentation methods, proved together with data augmentation to be very effective for brain tumor segmentation in MRI images. Our proposal was validated in the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2013 database (BRATS 2013), obtaining simultaneously the first position for the complete, core, and enhancing regions in Dice Similarity Coefficient metric (0.88, 0.83, 0.77) for the Challenge data set. Also, it obtained the overall first position by the online evaluation platform. We also participated in the on-site BRATS 2015 Challenge using the same model, obtaining the second place, with Dice Similarity Coefficient metric of 0.78, 0.65, and 0.75 for the complete, core, and enhancing regions, respectively.},

	abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental health disorders. As a neuro development disorder, neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), coupled with machine learning algorithms, are being increasingly explored as biomarkers in ADHD. Among various machine learning methods, deep learning has demonstrated excellent performance on many imaging tasks. With the availability of publically-available, large neuroimaging data sets for training purposes, deep learning-based automatic diagnosis of psychiatric disorders can become feasible. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based ADHD classification method via 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to MRI scans. Since deep neural networks may utilize millions of parameters, even the large number of MRI samples in pooled data sets is still relatively limited if one is to learn discriminative features from the raw data. Instead, here we propose to first extract meaningful 3-D low-level features from functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) data. Furthermore, inspired by radiologists' typical approach for examining brain images, we design a 3-D CNN model to investigate the local spatial patterns of MRI features. Finally, we discover that brain functional and structural information are complementary, and design a multi-modality CNN architecture to combine fMRI and sMRI features. Evaluations on the hold-out testing data of the ADHD-200 global competition shows that the proposed multi-modality 3-D CNN approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 69.15\% and outperforms reported classifiers in the literature, even with fewer training samples. We suggest that multi-modality classification will be a promising direction to find potential neuroimaging biomarkers of neuro development disorders.},

Despite mortality due to communicable diseases, poverty, and human conflicts, dementia incidence is destined to increase in the developing world in tandem with the ageing population. Current data from developing countries suggest that age-adjusted dementia prevalence estimates in 65 year olds are high (â‰¥5\%) in certain Asian and Latin American countries, but consistently low (1â€“3\%) in India and sub-Saharan Africa; Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60\% whereas vascular dementia accounts for âˆ¼30\% of the prevalence. Early-onset familial forms of dementia with single-gene defects occur in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Illiteracy remains a risk factor for dementia. The APOE É›4 allele does not influence dementia progression in sub-Saharan Africans. Vascular factors, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes, are likely to increase the burden of dementia. Use of traditional diets and medicinal plant extracts might aid prevention and treatment. Dementia costs in developing countries are estimated to be US\$73 billion yearly, but care demands social protection, which seems scarce in these regions.},

We present criteria for all-cause dementia and for AD dementia. We retained the general framework of probable AD dementia from the 1984 criteria. On the basis of the past 27 years of experience, we made several changes in the clinical criteria for the diagnosis. We also retained the term possible AD dementia, but redefined it in a manner more focused than before. Biomarker evidence was also integrated into the diagnostic formulations for probable and possible AD dementia for use in research settings. The core clinical criteria for AD dementia will continue to be the cornerstone of the diagnosis in clinical practice, but biomarker evidence is expected to enhance the pathophysiological specificity of the diagnosis of AD dementia. Much work lies ahead for validating the biomarker diagnosis of AD dementia.},

Pattern recognition models built upon functional connectivity (FC) measures derived from resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data have been successfully used to predict the brain age. However, most existing studies focus on coarse-grained FC measures between brain regions or intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), which may sacrifice fine-grained FC information of the rsfMRI data. Whole brain voxel-wise FC measures could provide fine-grained FC information of the brain and may improve the prediction performance. In this study, we develop a deep learning method to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn informative features from the fine-grained whole brain FC measures for the brain age prediction. Experimental results on a large dataset of resting-state fMRI demonstrate that the deep learning model with fine-grained FC measures could better predict the brain age.},

Therefore, neurodegenerative disease is considered as accelerated ageing. Accurate detection of accelerated ageing based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is a relatively new direction of research in computational neuroscience as it has the potential to offer positive clinical outcome through early intervention. In order to capture the faster structural alterations in the brain with ageing, we propose in this paper a computational approach for modelling the MRI-based structure of the brain using the framework of hidden Markov models, which can be utilized for age prediction. Experiments were carried out on healthy subjects to validate its accuracy and its robustness. The results have shown its ability of predicting the brain age with an average normalized age-gap error of two to three years, which is superior to several recently developed methods for brain age prediction.},

From this sample we obtained different anatomical feature sets: (1) 11 larger brain regions (including cortical volume, thickness, area, subcortical volume, cerebellar volume, etc.), (2) 148 cortical compartmental thickness measures, (3) 148 cortical compartmental area measures, (4) 148 cortical compartmental volume measures, and (5) a combination of the above-mentioned measures. With these anatomical feature sets, we predicted age using 6 statistical techniques (multiple linear regression, ridge regression, neural network, k-nearest neighbourhood, support vector machine, and random forest). We obtained very good age prediction accuracies, with the highest accuracy being R2 = 0.84 (prediction on the basis of a neural network and support vector machine approaches for the entire data set) and the lowest being R2 = 0.40 (prediction on the basis of a k-nearest neighborhood for cortical surface measures). Interestingly, the easy-to-calculate multiple linear regression approach with the 11 large brain compartments resulted in a very good prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.73), whereas the application of the neural network approach for this data set revealed very good age prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.83). Taken together, these results demonstrate that age can be predicted well on the basis of anatomical measures. The neural network approach turned out to be the approach with the best results. In addition, it was evident that good prediction accuracies can be achieved using a small but nevertheless age-representative dataset of brain features. Hum Brain Mapp 38:997â€“1008, 2017.

	abstract = {Brain age estimation from anatomical features has been attracting more attention in recent years. This interest in brain age estimation is motivated by the importance of biological age prediction in health informatics, with an application to early prediction of neurocognitive disorders. It is well known that normal brain aging follows a specific pattern, which enables researchers and practitioners to predict the age of a humanâ€™s brain from its degeneration. In this paper, we model brain age predicted by cortical thickness data gathered from large cohort brain images. We collected 2,911 cognitively normal subjects (age 45-91 years) at a single medical center and acquired their brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. All images were acquired using the same scanner with the same protocol. We propose to first apply Sparse Group Lasso (SGL) for feature selection by utilizing the brainâ€™s anatomical grouping. Once the features are selected, a non-parametric non-linear regression using the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm is applied to fit the final age prediction model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the mean absolute error of 4.05 years, which is comparable with or superior to several recent methods. Our method can also be a critical tool for clinicians to differentiate patients with neurodegenerative brain disease by extracting a cortical thinning pattern associated with normal aging.},

	abstract = {Recent resting-state functional MRI investigations have demonstrated that much of the large-scale functional network architecture supporting motor, sensory and cognitive functions in older pediatric and adult populations is present in term- and prematurely-born infants. Application of new analytical approaches can help translate the improved understanding of early functional connectivity provided through these studies into predictive models of neurodevelopmental outcome. One approach to achieving this goal is multivariate pattern analysis, a machine-learning, pattern classification approach well-suited for high-dimensional neuroimaging data. It has previously been adapted to predict brain maturity in children and adolescents using structural and resting state-functional MRI data. In this study, we evaluated resting state-functional MRI data from 50 preterm-born infants (born at 23â€“29weeks of gestation and without moderateâ€“severe brain injury) scanned at term equivalent postmenstrual age compared with data from 50 term-born control infants studied within the first week of life. Using 214 regions of interest, binary support vector machines distinguished term from preterm infants with 84\% accuracy (p{\textless}0.0001). Inter- and intra-hemispheric connections throughout the brain were important for group categorization, indicating that widespread changes in the brain's functional network architecture associated with preterm birth are detectable by term equivalent age. Support vector regression enabled quantitative estimation of birth gestational age in single subjects using only term equivalent resting state-functional MRI data, indicating that the present approach is sensitive to the degree of disruption of brain development associated with preterm birth (using gestational age as a surrogate for the extent of disruption). This suggests that support vector regression may provide a means for predicting neurodevelopmental outcome in individual infants.},

	abstract = {Objective The long-term effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) can resemble observed in normal ageing, suggesting that TBI may accelerate the ageing process. We investigate this using a neuroimaging model that predicts brain age in healthy individuals and then apply it to TBI patients. We define individuals' differences in chronological and predicted structural 'brain age,' and test whether TBI produces progressive atrophy and how this relates to cognitive function. Methods A predictive model of normal ageing was defined using machine learning in 1,537 healthy individuals, based on magnetic resonance imagingâ€“derived estimates of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). This ageing model was then applied to test 99 TBI patients and 113 healthy controls to estimate brain age. Results The initial model accurately predicted age in healthy individuals (r = 0.92). TBI brains were estimated to be 'older,' with a mean predicted age difference (PAD) between chronological and estimated brain age of 4.66 years (Â±10.8) for GM and 5.97 years (Â±11.22) for WM. This PAD predicted cognitive impairment and correlated strongly with the time since TBI, indicating that brain tissue loss increases throughout the chronic postinjury phase. Interpretation TBI patients' brains were estimated to be older than their chronological age. This discrepancy increases with time since injury, suggesting that TBI accelerates the rate of brain atrophy. This may be an important factor in the increased susceptibility in TBI patients for dementia and other age-associated conditions, motivating further research into the age-like effects of brain injury and other neurological diseases.
